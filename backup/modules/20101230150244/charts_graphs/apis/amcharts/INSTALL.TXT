You need to download amCharts files from: 
http://www.amcharts.com/download

amCharts ships as several zips with sophisticated folder structure in each one of them. 
You need to hunt down following files:

amcolumn.swf  
amline.swf  
ampie.swf  
swfobject.js

and place them in the "downloaded" folder of the module (directly
without any folder structure inside "downloaded").

Sorry for the inconvenience, but there's really nothing we
can do about it due to licenses restrictions and Drupal policy
to not ship anything non-GPL with the module code.

CAUTION: Do NOT assume you don't need swfobject.js since
charts_graphs already requires swfobject Drupal module. Unfortunately,
the versions of the two js files are different, so you can
not re-use swfobject from the module file for amCharts the way
you can re-use it for OFC2
