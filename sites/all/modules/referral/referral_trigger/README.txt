Referral will invoke a Drupal Trigger after a referral generates a signup.
Visit 'admin/build/trigger/referral' to assign an action to the trigger.
The only core Drupal action that is available to the trigger is "Send e-mail"
action.

Note that you must first configure an Action before you can assign it to a Trigger.
