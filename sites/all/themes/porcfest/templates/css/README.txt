  /ie/ie-example.css
    An empty IE stylesheet to support the Conditional Styles module. 
    This module allows themes to specify conditional stylesheets in 
    their info file and the conditional comments will be automatically 
    included at the end of the standard $styles variable. 
    
    Note: You do not need to install the module, it is included inGenesis.
 
    Uncomment or add the required stylesheets in your subthemes .info file.
    
    
  _all-subtheme-tidy.css
    The is a copy of _all-subtheme.css but with all the empty selectors
    and comments removed. Use this if you only want a very basic
    starter CSS file. See your subthemes .info file for instructions
    on how to enable the use of this stylesheet.
  
  _all-subtheme.css
    The all-subtheme stylesheet is all the modular stylesheets aggreated
    into one. Use this if you run into Internet Explorer's max 30
    stylesheet issue or if you need to reduce http requests and cannot
    use the CSS aggregation and compression feature of Drupal 6.
    See your subthemes .info file for instructions on how to enable 
    the use of this stylesheet.
